# STS - Smart Training System



## Project Abstract

**Smart Training System** is a web-based platform that will be designed to assist coaches in monitoring and analyzing player performance in real-time. The application will provide key physical statistics, including heart rate, body temperature and respiratory rate. Utilizing distributed data streams from sensors, the platform will enhance real-time decision-making during training and matches.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Seamlessly integrates data from various sensors to provide up-to-the-minute statistics.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures that different users have appropriate access levels based on their roles.
- **Comprehensive REST API**: Facilitates easy integration with the web portal and future mobile applications, allowing for scalability and flexibility.

This system aims to empower coaches with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions that improve team performance and player development.
