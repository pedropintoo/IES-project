# Introduction

**STS â€“ Smart Training System** is a digital solution intended to help coaches oversee and assess player performance in real-time. This project is being developed as part of the **Introduction to Software Engineering (IES)** course. The main objective of this assignment is not solely the delivery of a final product, but rather the focus on applying software development processes and methodologies.

To effectively manage our development process, we will implement tools and practices such as:

- **Backlog Management**: Tracking tasks to ensure organized progress.
- **GitHub Actions**: Facilitating continuous integration and deployment.
- **Docusaurus**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation.

Additionally, **weekly meetings** will be held to facilitate organization and communication within the team.

By prioritizing collaboration and clear communication, we aim to maintain a structured workflow that emphasizes continuous testing, integration, and validation of each module while ensuring alignment with the project objectives.
