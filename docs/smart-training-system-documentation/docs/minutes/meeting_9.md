## Key Discussion Points
- **Expansion of API Endpoints**: The team identified additional endpoints needed for functionality and will prioritize their implementation in the begining of the current iteration using Spring Boot.
- **Docker-Compose file Corrections**: It was noted that the Docker-Compose file required adjustments, specifically the addition of volumes, to ensure data persistence and proper container functionality.
