## Meeting Date
**October 11, 2024**

## Attendees
- Danilo Micael Gregório Silva
- Pedro Miguel Azevedo Pinto
- João Pedro Azevedo Pinto
- Tomás Santos Fernandes

## Agenda
- Review of documentation tasks
- Architecture discussions
- Figma prototype progress

## Key Discussion Points
- Switch from RabbitMQ to Kafka: The team decided to switch the messaging system from RabbitMQ to Kafka for scalability and performance reasons.
- Prototype layout inspiration: The team agreed to download the WHOOP app to draw inspiration for the layout in Figma, especially for user interfaces focused on biometric data.
- Docusaurus release and GitHub Pages deployment: The team is finalizing the release of the Docusaurus documentation site and preparing for deployment to GitHub Pages.
- Biometric API research: The need to find an available API to fetch biometric data from a smartwatch was discussed. This is essential for integrating live health metrics into the system.

## Action Items
- **Danilo** is responsible for: 
  - 1) Set up the Figma environment for prototyping
  - 2) Collaborate on the Figma prototype design

- **Pedro** will:
  - 1) Research whether to use Elasticsearch for logging or integrate Log4j
  - 2) Collaborate on the Figma prototype design

- **João** : 
  - 1) Research available APIs for fetching biometric data from smartwatches
  - 2) Collaborate on the Figma prototype design

- **Tomás** will: 
  - 1) Complete the release of the Docusaurus site and deploy it on GitHub Pages, ensuring the documentation is well-organized
  - 2) Collaborate on the Figma prototype design

## Next Steps
- All team members should work on their assigned tasks to submit the iteration by October 21, 2024, for review.
- Define the API endpoints and begin handling the integration with the selected biometric API.
