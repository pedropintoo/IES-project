# Meeting 3 - October 15, 2024

## Meeting Date
**October 15, 2024**

## Attendees
- Danilo Micael Gregório Silva
- Pedro Miguel Azevedo Pinto
- João Pedro Azevedo Pinto
- Tomás Santos Fernandes

## Agenda
- Review of Figma prototype design
- Detailed discussion on specific pages for different user roles (Player, Coach, Team Director, Admin, Personal Trainer)

## Key Discussion Points
- Player Page: The layout focuses on displaying key performance stats (e.g., fatigue level, heart rate, speed) in a clean, visual format. Players can also track their historical performance over time and set personal goals. The interface prioritizes ease of access to stats and progress.
- Coach Page: Designed for real-time monitoring of all players on the team. Coaches will have access to live biometric data (like heart rate, fatigue, and effort levels) during matches or training sessions. Additionally, the coach will be able to compare current stats with past performance to adjust strategies.
- Team Director Page: Focuses on a broader overview of the team's overall performance, progress over time, and budget management. Directors will be able to view aggregate data for the team and receive notifications regarding critical performance updates or financial decisions.
- Admin Page: Centralized dashboard with system management capabilities, including user roles, permissions, and the ability to generate reports on the app's usage and performance. Admins will also manage data security and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
- Personal Trainer Page: A tailored interface that gives personal trainers access to specific players they are assigned to. The focus will be on detailed biometric data to customize training plans and monitor each player's physical condition in real-time. Trainers can also send alerts or feedback to players based on their performance and health metrics.
