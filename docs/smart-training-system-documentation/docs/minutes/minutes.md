# Meeting Minutes Overview

Welcome to the **Meeting Minutes** section of the documentation. This folder contains the detailed records of all meetings that will take place during the development of the **Smart Training System** project.

## Purpose

The meeting minutes serve the following purposes:

- **Documentation of Decisions**: All decisions made during the meetings are documented for future reference.
- **Tracking Progress**: The minutes help track the progress of the project by noting what has been discussed, planned, and completed.
- **Accountability**: They provide a written record of tasks assigned to each team member and their deadlines, ensuring accountability within the team.
- **Communication**: Team members who may have missed the meeting can review the minutes to stay informed.

## How to Use This Section

- Each meeting will have a dedicated file in the **minutes** folder.
- These files will contain detailed summaries of the topics discussed, action items, and any decisions made.
- Use this section to keep track of project milestones, assigned tasks, and key discussions.

## Next Steps

As meetings are held, their minutes will be added here, with the date and key points highlighted for easy reference. Each entry will include:

- **Meeting Date**
- **Attendees**
- **Agenda**
- **Key Discussion Points**
- **Action Items**

Check back frequently to stay updated on the latest developments!
