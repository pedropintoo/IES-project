# Project Abstract

**Smart Training System** is a web-based platform designed to assist coaches in monitoring and analyzing player performance in real-time. The application provides key physical statistics, including fatigue levels, heart rate, and effort, as well as in-game metrics like ball possession and shots on target. Utilizing distributed data streams from actual sensors or simulated sources, the platform enhances real-time decision-making during training sessions and matches. 

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Seamlessly integrates data from various sensors to provide up-to-the-minute statistics.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures that different users have appropriate access levels based on their roles.
- **Comprehensive REST API**: Facilitates easy integration with the web portal and future mobile applications, allowing for scalability and flexibility.

This system aims to empower coaches with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions that improve team performance and player development.
