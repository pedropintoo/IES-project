# Key Requirements and Constraints

There are several key requirements and constraints that significantly impact the design and architecture of the system. These include performance needs, integration with external systems, scalability, and long-term maintainability. The architecture must address these critical factors to ensure smooth operation and adaptability. 

## Real-Time Data Ingestion and Processing

The system will handle real-time data streams from physical sensors (IoT devices) and external data sources (e.g., competition data). This requires the architecture to support high-throughput message processing with minimal latency. To address this, RabbitMQ is used to manage and distribute tasks asynchronously, allowing the backend to process large volumes of data without bottlenecks. 

**Key Constraint**: The architecture must handle spikes in data streams and manage processing effectively under conditions where large amounts of sensor data are ingested continuously. 

## Multiple Platforms and User Interfaces

The system will be accessed from various platforms, including web browsers, mobile devices (in the future), and potentially large screens for data visualization (e.g., real-time dashboards or performance monitoring). The chosen frontend technologies (React, Tailwind CSS) ensure responsive and cross-platform compatibility, making the system accessible from different user devices. 

**Key Requirement**: The system must maintain a consistent and optimized user experience across different platforms (desktop, mobile (in future), large screen displays). 

## Data Storage and Scalability

The system will store both relational data (e.g., user profiles, competition results) and time-series data (e.g., sensor readings). PostgreSQL is used for relational data, and TimescaleDB is integrated for efficient time-series data handling. The architecture needs to ensure scalability, allowing for the storage and querying of large datasets as the number of users and data points grows. 

**Key Constraint**: The system must efficiently store and retrieve data, especially for time-based queries, without compromising performance as the data grows over time. 

## High Availability and Load Balancing

The system must be robust enough to handle increased loads, especially during peak times, such as during real-time data monitoring or major events. Nginx is used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to ensure that the system can scale horizontally, distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of the backend. 

**Key Requirement**: The architecture must support horizontal scalability to handle high-traffic periods without downtime and ensure efficient load distribution. 

## Security and SSL/TLS Encryption

The system will interact with potentially sensitive data, such as user profiles and sensor data. Therefore, security is critical. Nginx handles SSL/TLS encryption for secure communications, and the backend will incorporate authentication and authorization mechanisms for controlling data access. 

**Key Constraint**: The system must ensure data protection and secure access, following best practices for API security. 

## Modular and Maintainable Architecture

The architecture must be designed for long-term maintenance and future expansion. With the use of Spring Boot and Docker, the system can be containerized, making it easier to deploy updates, isolate components, and manage dependencies. This also ensures that individual services (e.g., RabbitMQ, databases) can be scaled or replaced without disrupting the entire system. 

**Key Requirement**: The architecture must be modular to allow for the independent deployment of services, minimizing downtime and allowing for the evolution of the system over time. 

## Performance Monitoring and Logging

As the system will run in a production environment, it is essential to monitor performance and logs in real-time. The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) must be integrated to provide real-time monitoring, log aggregation, and troubleshooting. This enables the development team to track performance metrics and quickly resolve any issues that arise in production. 

**Key Requirement**: The system must provide robust monitoring and logging capabilities, enabling the team to keep track of system health, detect anomalies, and address performance bottlenecks. 

## Dockerized Deployment

The system needs to be deployable across multiple environments (development, staging, production) with minimal configuration changes. The use of Docker ensures that each component (backend, frontend, databases) runs in isolated containers, making it easier to maintain consistency across environments and simplifying the deployment process. 

**Key Requirement**: The system must be easily deployable and portable across environments, ensuring consistent behavior and performance from development to production.
