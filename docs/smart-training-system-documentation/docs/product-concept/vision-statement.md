## Vision Statement

**Smart Training System (STS)** is a web-based application designed to support **coaches**, **team directors**, **personal trainers**, and **players** in real-time monitoring and analysis of player performance. It addresses the need for immediate access to crucial metrics such as:

- **Heart Rate**
- **Body Temperature**
- **Respiratory Rate**

By providing these insights, the platform enhances decision-making during training and matches, allowing coaches to optimize player performance and strategies effectively.

## Problem Statement

The primary problem our system aims to solve is the **lack of accessible real-time performance data**, which limits coaches’ and trainers’ ability to make informed adjustments.Key features designed to address this include:

- **User Access Management** for team directors
- **Performance Statistics** for coaches
- **Historical Tracking** for players

These features focus on delivering targeted functionality that meets the specific needs of each user role.

## Project Focus

The project **initially** aimed to offer extensive features for football fans, including comprehensive coverage of the English Football League and the Premier League. However, the focus **has now shifted** towards addressing the needs of coaches, team directors, and personal trainers from clubs **worldwide** who seek **advanced analysis tools to improve decision-making** during training sessions and matches.

## Differentiation

The **STS platform** differentiates itself by emphasizing:

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Immediate feedback and adjustments
- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Tailored for coaches, team directors, personal trainers, and players

This focus enables immediate feedback and adjustments, setting it apart from **existing solutions** that primarily **rely on post-game** and in-train analysis.

## Development Insights

The project concept emerged from **team collaboration** and **insights from professors**, ensuring relevance to practical needs. **User stories** outlining features like:

- **Permission Management**
- **Real-Time Performance Tracking**
